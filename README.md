#### Quality of Life
- Lombok is great. Don't want to have to write getters and settings? Don't! Add `@Getter` and/or `@Setter` to a class and have them auto generated at compile time! Also has other very useful annotations. [docs](https://projectlombok.org/features/)
- Apache Commons Lang 3 has a bunch of useful methods that can come in handy [javadoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.commons/commons-lang3/3.10/overview-summary.html)
